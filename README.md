# landing-page

In this project I was given an image of a landing page used new skills I learned in flex-box by making containers and alinging them to their designated areas for an organized replica of the page. Alongside with what I learned in html to make necessary containers. Also, used new css skills for an improved look with padding, gaps, margins, justifying, aligning, etc.
